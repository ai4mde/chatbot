# ChatFront Service

This directory contains the frontend service (`chatfront`) for the chatbot application. It is built using the Remix framework and provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Features

*   **Remix Framework:** Leverages Remix for server-side rendering (SSR), client-side hydration, routing, and data loading.
*   **React & TypeScript:** Built with React for the UI component model and TypeScript for strong typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, along with Radix UI primitives and Lucide icons for building the user interface.
*   **Component Library:** Includes various UI components likely found in `app/components/`.
*   **Diagramming:** Integrates `reactflow`, `dagre`, and `elkjs`, indicating capabilities for rendering diagrams (e.g., UML diagrams generated by the backend).
*   **Markdown Rendering:** Supports rendering Markdown content with syntax highlighting (`react-markdown`, `rehype-highlight`, `prismjs`, `shiki`).
*   **Authentication:** Includes `remix-auth` for handling user authentication flows.
*   **State Management:** Likely uses Remix loaders/actions and potentially React context/hooks for state management.
*   **Containerization:** Provides a `Dockerfile` for building container images (compatible with Docker and Podman).
*   **Package Management:** Uses Bun (`bun.lock`) for package management and running scripts.
*   **Nix Environment:** Includes `shell.nix` for setting up a development environment using Nix.

## Key Components

*   `app/`: Contains the core application source code:
    *   `root.tsx`: The main application layout and entry point.
    *   `routes/`: Defines application pages and API routes.
    *   `components/`: Reusable React UI components.
    *   `tailwind.css`: Tailwind CSS setup and custom styles.
    *   `lib/`, `utils/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `types/`: Supporting code modules.
*   `public/`: Static assets served directly (e.g., favicons, images).
*   `remix.config.js`: Configuration file for the Remix build process.
*   `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
*   `package.json`: Lists dependencies and scripts.
*   `bun.lockb`: Bun lock file.
*   `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker/Podman image.
*   `shell.nix`: Nix development environment setup.


## TODO

*   [ ] Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests (e.g., using Playwright or Cypress).
*   [ ] Add unit tests for critical components and utility functions.
*   [ ] Improve UI/UX based on user feedback.
*   [ ] Enhance accessibility (a11y) across all components.
*   [ ] Optimize frontend performance (bundle size, rendering speed).
*   [ ] Refactor complex components for better readability and maintainability.
*   [ ] Add detailed documentation for custom hooks and components.
*   [ ] Set up consistent error boundaries and reporting.
*   [ ] Define and implement a robust state management strategy if needed beyond Remix loaders/actions.
